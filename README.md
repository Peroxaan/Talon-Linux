# Talon-Linux

[Talon](https://peroxaan.com/Talon) is a simple webhook manager built for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the Web. It was initially released on iOS and Web in June 2020, Android and macOS in August 2020, and will be coming to Windows (and now Linux!) this year.

Talon was also the first Peroxaan app to be released.

This Linux port is mostly just a fun project for me (Michael) - so don't expect updates to be as consistent as they are on iOS/macOS, Android, and Windows. Regardless - its open source, so feel free to contribute to it!

## To-do list
- Build up a nice UI
- Discord Webhooks
- Slack Webhooks
- Custom Webhooks/POST Requests

## Notes
Talon Pro features, such as Link Shortening, will not be built in since I don't feel like implementing a payments system into the app. The Web version also does not have Talon Pro features. To take advantage of those, you'll have to check out our iOS/macOS or Android app.
